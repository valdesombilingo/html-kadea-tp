      <h2>Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
          University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression-era program known as
          the "National Youth Administration".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
          Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans.
          "I saw how food changed them," he said. "All of this left scars on
          me."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
          Forestry Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1938</strong> - Marries his wife of 69 years, Margaret Gibson.
          Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
          he returns to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him about
          breeding pest-resistant plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
          Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his
          lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,
          and other applied science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
          Pathology.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from DuPont,
          leaves behind his wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
          pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
          different strains of disease-resistant wheat, including different
          varieties for each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each
          season, doubling wheat yields.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy breed of wheat with a
          high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to
          fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
          strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
          mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Wins the Nobel Peace Prize.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - Helps seven African countries dramatically
          increase their maize and sorghum yields.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
          University.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - States, "We will have to double the world food
          supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only
          way we can meet the demand as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
          crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
          modifying plants and animals for a long time. Before we called it
          science, people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li><strong>2006</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
